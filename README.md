# restaurant_CRUD_MERN_application

This is a CRUD application for storing my restaurant ratings as cards. Used MVC architecture and MERN stack.

PURPOSE:
Simple storage of restaurant ratings (input restaurant name, your rating, and type of cuisine).
Results will show as cards.

BUILT WITH:

- MongoDB
- Express
- React
- Node.js
- Vite
- Tailwind

INSTALLATION/USAGE:
Install npm in command line (npm install -g npm).
The frontend folder is within the larger project folder containing backend files.
The included .env_sample file is a template for your .env file; please update with the MongoDB URL and your IP address.
To run frontend: navigate to react-frontend/react-frontend within the project folder and run "npm run dev" in command line.
To run backend: navigate to main project folder and run "npm run dev" in command line.

LESSONS LEARNED:
This was my first project using React framework and Tailwind for designing the frontend. I had to learn from github user devtamin's NodeAPIV2 instructions to be able to create this project. This project helepd me to gain a better understanding of MVC architecture and how frontend and backend fit together.

ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT:
Future directions would be to style the restaurant cards into more of a table format. I would also like to extend the backend side of this project to incorporate public APIs with restaurant reviews.

CREDITS:
Credit to devtamin's github as a reference for learning how to write React code and as a general template.
